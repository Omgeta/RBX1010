# 4. Tables

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"

    - be familiar with Lua tables
    - understand the uses of metatables and metamethods

## Tables as Associative Arrays

Tables in Lua are neither values nor variables but _objects_. The table type implements associative arrays, which are arrays that can be indexed not only by numbers, but also by strings or any other value of the language, except nil. Unlike in other languages, tables in Lua do not have a fixed size and can have as many elements as necessary. We use tables to represent ordinary arrays, dictionaries, sets, queues and other data structures. All tables are created with the `{}` _constructor expression_.

### Arrays

```lua
local a = {}
```

### Dictionaries

```lua
local a = {}
```
