## Overview

A [Stack](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)>) is a very common data structure used in programming which stores values in last in, first out order (LIFO). Implement a stack as a class in Lua to store arbitrary values of any type.

Recall that classes can be created like:

```lua
local Box = {}
Box.__index = Box

function Box.new(x) -- static constructor
  local self = setmetatable({}, Box)
  self.x = x
  return self
end

function Box:get() -- instance method (note ':')
  return self.x
end

return Box
```

## Tasks

### Task 1: `Stack` class

Create a skeleton `Stack` class with the constructor and necessary fields. Add a `toString` method so that the string representation as shown in the examples below could be returned.

For instance:

```lua
local stack = Stack.new(3)  -- stack with max size 3
print(stack.toString())     -- should print "[]"
```

### Task 2: `push()` and `pop()`

Add `push()` and `pop()` methods to manipulate the stack. `push(x)` should push the value of `x` onto the top of the stack. `pop()` should pop the top value off the stack and return it. Also modify the `toString()` method to correctly display the values in the stack.

For instance:

```lua
local stack = Stack.new(3)
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(stack.toString())     -- should print "[1 2]"
local popped = stack.pop()
print(popped)               -- should print "2"
print(stack.toString())     -- should print "[1]"
```

### Task 3: `isFull()` and `isEmpty()`

Add `isFull()` and `isEmpty()` methods which check if the stack is full or empty

For instance:

```lua
local stack = Stack.new(1)
stack.push(1)
print(stack.isFull())   -- should print "true"
print(stack.isEmpty())  -- should print "false"
```

### Task 4: Bounds checking

Use the `isFull()` and `isEmpty()` methods in your code to make sure that `push()` and `pop()` do not add/remove values innappropriately.

For instance:

```lua
local stack = Stack.new(1)
stack.pop()     -- should print "error: stack empty"
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)   -- should print "error: stack full"
```
