## Overview

A [Stack](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)>) is a very common data structure used in programming which stores values in last in, first out order (LIFO). Implement a stack as a class in Lua to store arbitrary values of any type.

Recall that classes can be created like:

```lua
local Box = {}
Box.__index = Box

function Box.new(x) -- static constructor
  local self = setmetatable({}, Box)
  self.x = x
  return self
end

function Box:Get() -- instance method (note ':')
  return self.x
end

return Box
```

## Tasks

### Task 1: `Stack` class

Create a skeleton `Stack` class with the constructor and necessary fields. Add a `toString` method so that the string representation as shown in the examples below could be returned.

For instance:

```lua
local stack = Stack.new(3)  -- stack with max size 3
print(stack:toString())     -- should print "[]"
```

### Task 2: `Push()` and `Pop()`

Add `Push()` and `Pop()` methods to manipulate the stack. `Push(x)` should push the value of `x` onto the top of the stack. `Pop()` should pop the top value off the stack and return it. Also modify the `toString()` method to correctly display the values in the stack.

For instance:

```lua
local stack = Stack.new(3)
stack:Push(1)
stack:Push(2)
print(stack:toString())     -- should print "[1 2]"
local popped = stack:Pop()
print(popped)               -- should print "2"
print(stack:toString())     -- should print "[1]"
```

### Task 3: `IsFull()` and `IsEmpty()`

Add `IsFull()` and `IsEmpty()` methods which check if the stack is full or empty

For instance:

```lua
local stack = Stack.new(1)
stack:Push(1)
print(stack.IsFull())   -- should print "true"
print(stack.IsEmpty())  -- should print "false"
```

### Task 4: Bounds checking

Use the `IsFull()` and `IsEmpty()` methods in your code to make sure that `Push()` and `Pop()` do not add/remove values innappropriately.

For instance:

```lua
local stack = Stack.new(1)
stack:Pop()     -- should print "error: stack empty"
stack:Push(1)
stack:Push(2)   -- should print "error: stack full"
```

## Solution

=== "Lua"

    ```luau
    --8<-- "code/prac1/Stack.luau"
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    --8<-- "code/prac1/Stack.java"
    ```

## Extra

Consider what else we can do with stacks? What if we wanted stacks to be of dynamic size? Could be implement stacks more simply just by using tables? How can we use stacks in game development?
