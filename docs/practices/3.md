## Overview

We want to create a simple Settings menu with different pages but Roblox only has some basic GUI classes to work with. We will use OOP to design reusable UI components for our settings menu. Firstly, we will focus on designing a single SettingsButton class which contains a description of a setting and a display of the current option.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Setting up `ScreenGui` and `Frame`

Before we can start displaying any [GuiObject](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/GuiObject) on the screen, we need to set up a container for all GuiObjects we want to render for the player.

Unlike the custom pseudoclasses we have written in Lua so far, Roblox Engine Classes which are all subclasses of [Instance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance) must be constructed with the `Instance.new(className)` constructor.

For example, here we create a Part, make it transparent and add it to the workspace:

```lua
local part = Instance.new("Part")   -- ref to an unrendered part (parent = nil)
part.Transparency = 0.5
part.Parent = game.Workspace        -- set parent last as an optimization to not render early
```

In the case of GUIs, `GuiObjects` only render if they are somewhere under a `ScreenGui` object which is placed in the players `PlayerGui` folder. Typically, we will also have a `Frame` under the `ScreenGui` which is a container for related `GuiObjects`.

Write a LocalScript under either the [ReplicatedFirst](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ReplicatedFirst) or [StarterGui](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/StarterGui) folders which creates the necessary hierarchy of `ScreenGui` and `Frame` such that new `GuiObjects` such as `TextLabel` can be rendered.

Recall that we can get a reference to the players `PlayerGui` folder like so:

```luau
local playerGui = game.Players.LocalPlayer.PlayerGui
local playerGui = script.Parent     -- only works if the script is in the StarterGui folder
```

Remember to also adjust the `Frame` fields so that it takes up the whole screen (or however much of the screen as you want) for us to test our future `SettingsButton`.

### Task 2: `SettingsButton` constructor

Now we are finally ready to create our `SettingsButton` class. Note that in the image example, we have two types of settings buttons: one that changes between several options (e.g. View Distance changing between Low, Medium High) and another that runs some function (e.g. Save Progress saving to the database). For simplicity sake, we will only write the latter for now.

We should use composition in this implementation with these suggested fields:

- `self.label` (`TextLabel` containing the setting name)
- `self.icon` (`ImageLabel` containing the setting icon)
- `self.button` (`ImageButton` which is the parent of `label` and `icon`)
- `self.callback` (`function` that we want to call on button press)

We should be able to create a `SettingsButton` like so:

```luau
local frame = ... --- parent frame
local saveData = function() print("Saving...") end
local saveIcon = "rbxassetid://12967618029"
local settingsButton = SettingsButton.new("Save Progress", saveIcon, saveData, frame)
```

### Task 3: Connecting callbacks

Roblox follows event-based programming which means that most, if not all `Instance` come with events which we can attach callback functions to. For our case, we want to attach our callback to the `Activated` event on `ImageButton`.

For example, this `Part` calls a function when touched (i.e. the `Touched` event is fired).

```luau
local part = game.Workspace.Part1   -- some arbitrary part
local function hello()
    print("Hello world!")
end
part.Touched:Connect(hello)

```

### Task 4: `Destroy()` cleanup

We should also implement a `Destroy()` method to delete all instances and disconnect all events.

For example, this is how we destroy a `Box` containing many `Part`s

```luau
...
function Box.new()
    local self = setmetatable({}, Box)
    self.partOne = Instance.new("Part")
    self.partTwo = Instance.new("Part")
    return self
end

function Box:Destroy()
    self.partOne:Destroy()
    self.partTwo:Destroy()
    setmetatable(self, nil) -- break linkage to metatable
end
...
```

If we create connections, we may also want to explictly disconnect them.

## Solution

=== "StarterPlayerScripts/Client.luau"

    ```luau
    local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
    local SettingsButton = require(ReplicatedStorage.Modules.SettingsButton)
    local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer

    -- Create GUI and Frame containers
    local gui = Instance.new("ScreenGui")
    gui.Parent = player:WaitForChild("PlayerGui")
    local frame = Instance.new("Frame")
    frame.Size = UDim2.new(1, 0, 1, 0)
    frame.Transparency = 1
    frame.Parent = gui

    -- Create SettingsButton instance
    local saveData = function()
        print("Saving...")
    end
    local saveIcon = "rbxassetid://12345678"
    local settingsButton = SettingsButton.new("Save Progress", saveIcon, saveData, frame)
    ```

=== "ReplicatedStorage/SettingsButton.luau"

    ```luau
    local SettingsButton = {}

    SettingsButton.__index = SettingsButton

    function SettingsButton.new(text: string, image: string, callback: () -> (), parent: Instance)
    local self = setmetatable({}, SettingsButton)

        self.callback = callback

        local imageButton = Instance.new("ImageButton") :: ImageButton
        imageButton.Size = UDim2.new(0.4, 0, 0.2, 0)
        imageButton.AnchorPoint = Vector2.new(0.5, 0.5)
        imageButton.Position = UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)
        imageButton.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(200, 200, 200)
        imageButton.Activated:Connect(callback)
        self.button = imageButton

        local imageLabel: ImageLabel = Instance.new("ImageLabel")
        imageLabel.Image = image
        imageLabel.Parent = imageButton
        imageLabel.Size = UDim2.new(0, 20, 0, 20)
        imageLabel.AnchorPoint = Vector2.new(0, 0.5)
        imageLabel.Position = UDim2.new(0.8, 0, 0.5, 0)
        self.icon = imageLabel

        local textLabel: TextLabel = Instance.new("TextLabel")
        textLabel.Text = text
        textLabel.Parent = imageButton
        textLabel.AnchorPoint = Vector2.new(0, 0.5)
        textLabel.Position = UDim2.new(0.2, 0, 0.5, 0)
        self.label = textLabel

        self.button.Parent = parent

        return self
    end

    function SettingsButton:Destroy()
        self.label:Destroy()
        self.icon:Destroy()
        self.button:Destroy()
        setmetatable(self, nil)
    end

    return SettingsButton

    ```

This is not an ideal solution in the real world, but it suffices to show the application of classes for UI components.

## Extra

Why not try adding a header to the settings page using a `TextLabel`, or a `ScrollingFrame` under the main container so that we can have a long list of `SettingsButton`. Why not add more event connections like an onHover effect to make it more responsive? There are many different objects and constraints available to allow you to style and customize the UI. Read the [API](https://create.roblox.com/docs) and experiment.

Notice that _for this example_, we don't actually need any methods since we can use only the single constructor. Wouldn't it be wiser to just write this as a function as part of a `SettingsButton` module? Notice that classes only become really useful when we have to manage state as well as organise our code.

In an actual game, we might have many different types of settings options such as sliders and dropdown menus. In that case, we would write a general "abstract" class/local function which is used by concrete subclasses/ exported functions which we use in our menus. Try writing such an implementation.
