# 2. List

!!! info "Prerequisite"

    - Familiar with classes in Lua
    - Setup code editor with Lua

## Overview

A [List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) is a very common data structure that stores values in nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node. Unlike arrays (not tables), linked lists can dynamically grow or shrink and do not require contiguous memory. Implement a linked list as a class in Lua to store arbitrary values of any type.

Recall that classes can be created like:

```lua
local Box = {}
Box.__index = Box

function Box.new(x) -- static constructor
  local self = setmetatable({}, Box)
  self.x = x
  return self
end

function Box:get() -- instance method (note ':')
  return self.x
end

return Box
```

## Tasks

### Task 1: `List` class

Create a skeleton `List` class with the constructor and necessary fields. Add a `toString` method so that the string representation as shown in the examples below could be returned.

For instance:

```lua
local list = List.new(1)  -- create a single List node
print(list:toString())   -- should print "[1]"
```

### Task 2: `append()` and `pop()`

Add `append()` and `pop()` methods to manipulate the list. `append(x)` should append `x` in a `List` to the back. `pop()` should pop the last value in the list and return it. Also modify the `toString()` method to correctly display the values in the list.

For instance:

```lua
local list = List.new(1)
list.push(2)
print(list:toString())     -- should print "[1 2]"
local popped = list.pop()
print(popped)               -- should print "2"
print(list:toString())     -- should print "[1]"
```

### Task 3: `length()`

Add a `length()` method to get the length of the instance list.

For instance:

```lua
local list = List.new(1)
list:push(2)
list:push(3)
print(list:length())      -- should print "3"
```

### Task 4: `get(i)` and `remove(i)`

Add a `get(i)` method to retrieve the List at index `i` (1-based). The method should traverse and return the `List` node if it exists, or `nil` if the index is out of bounds. Add a `remove(i)` method to remove only the `List` at index `i` and return it.

Hint: consider using two traversal variables

For instance:

```lua
local list = List.new(1)
list:push(2)
list:push(3)
print(list.get(2):toString())       -- should print "[2 3]"
print(list.remove(2):toString())    -- should print "[2]"
print(list:toString())              -- should print "[1 3]"
```

## Solution

=== "Lua"

    ```luau
    --8<-- "code/prac2/List.luau"
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    --8<-- "code/prac2/List.java"
    ```

## Extra

Consider what else we can do with lists? Is there a point of implementing lists when we already have tables? How could you use tables to write a much terser linked list? How could we use lists in game development?
